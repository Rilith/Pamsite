About the Project

Pamsite is a personal website that pays homage to the early days of the internet. It features a retro design with bright neon colors, animated GIFs, and a playful layout. The site includes multiple pages:

    Home: A welcoming page with a marquee and navigation.

    About Me: A page showcasing my interests, including Evangelion, Studio Ghibli, Metal Gear, Omori, and Persona 5, with tons of GIFs!

    Links: A collection of my favorite websites, including the Internet Archive and the first website ever created.

    Guestbook: A fun interactive section where visitors can leave messages (frontend-only for now).

This project is a love letter to the internet of the past, and I hope it brings back fond memories for you!
