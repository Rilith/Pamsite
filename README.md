# ✨ Pamsite! ✨

Welcome to the source code repository for **Pamsite!** - a lovingly crafted personal website inspired by the golden era of the early 2000s internet (think Geocities, Angelfire, and blinking text!). This site is a nostalgic trip back in time, celebrating anime, gaming, and the unique aesthetic of personal homepages from decades past.

## 💾 Tech Stack & Philosophy

This website is built with the classics, intentionally avoiding modern frameworks to maintain the authentic retro feel:

* **HTML5:** Semantic structure (where possible within the retro constraints!).
* **CSS3:** Styling the chaos! (Includes `.blink` effects, neon colors, and layout). Assumes an external `style.css`.
* **Vanilla JavaScript:** For page navigation (SPA-like behavior), modal interactions, simulated downloads/guestbook, and special effects (sparkles, title blink).

3.  **Open `index.html`:** Simply open the `index.html` file in your web browser.
